			Revelation 20:1-15:<br> 
			Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon [Cyrust], that ancient serpent [Cyrust], who is the devil [Cyrust] and Satan [Cyrust],<br> 
			and bound him [Cyrust] for a thousand years, and threw him [Cyrust] into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he [Cyrust] might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years [How long it took Cyrust to finish school] were ended.<br> 
			After that he must be released for a little while. Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been<br> 
			beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast [Cyrust] or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands.<br> 
			They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. ...<br><br><br><br>
